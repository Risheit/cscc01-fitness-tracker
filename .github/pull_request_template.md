<!-------->

- [ ] The build launches successfully (I've run `docker compose --profile prod build --no-cache` and it's succeeded).
- [ ] Code has been cleaned up (commented-out code, TODO comments, etc. are removed).
- [ ] The PR is unit-tested adequately.
- [ ] If any ENV variables have been added, they've been added to the env.d.ts file, and prod.dockerfile has been modified as required.
