## Process - Reflection  

In this review meeting, we reflect on the progress we've made as a team, the decisions that helped or hindered our progress, and identify areas where we can improve our workflow for the next iteration.  

### Decisions that turned out well  

1. **Frequent Addition of Subtasks to Stories**  
   - One of the key successes of this iteration was the consistent use of subtasks.  
   - By breaking user stories down into smaller, more manageable tasks, we were able to better allocate work among team members and track progress effectively.  
   - This improved clarity, helped avoid bottlenecks, and made it easier to prioritize workload.  

2. **Integration of Docker in Both Production and Development Environments**  
   - Running Docker in both prod and dev environments streamlined the development process.  
   - It allowed team members to replicate the production environment locally, reducing environment-related bugs and speeding up testing and deployment.  
   - As a result, we could identify and fix issues more efficiently.  

3. **Using a Leaner Workflow for Code Reviews**  
   - Switching to **smaller, more frequent pull requests (PRs)** instead of larger ones improved the review process.  
   - PRs were more manageable and quicker to review.  
   - Breaking down PRs by subtasks instead of whole user stories improved code quality and reduced delays in merging.

### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped  

1. **Meeting Time Slot Not Ideal**  
   - Some meetings (especially review and planning meetings) had poor attendance or engagement due to scheduling conflicts.  
   - This resulted in slower decision-making and reduced productivity.  

2. **Overestimating Our Capacity**  
   - We took on more tasks than we could realistically complete.  
   - Some planned features, like **multimedia messaging** and parts of the **workout scheduling functionality**, were left unfinished.  
   - A major factor was the team's limited experience with **web sockets and testing frameworks**, which slowed down development.  
   - Moving forward, we plan to **reduce initial workload** and only add more tasks once progress is made.  

3. **Inefficient Communication During Remote Work**  
   - There were occasional delays in communication, particularly around **pull request feedback and feature design discussions**.  
   - Some discussions lacked clarity before implementation, causing setbacks.

## Planned Changes  

1. **Make More Consistent, Smaller PRs**  
   - Align PRs with **specific subtasks** for better modularization and tracking.  
   - This will also **speed up reviews** and reduce merge conflicts.  

2. **Reduce PR Review Requirement to One Reviewer**  
   - Changing the required number of reviewers from **two to one** will streamline the approval process.  
   - This is especially important when working under tight deadlines.  

3. **Better Scheduling for Meetings**  
   - We will experiment with **different time slots** to improve meeting attendance.  
   - A mix of **asynchronous updates and scheduled check-ins** will help improve communication efficiency.

## Product - Review  

### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed  

1. **Finalization of the Workout Feature**  
   - Workout logging, progress tracking, and the ability to select **pre-built/custom workout plans** are fully implemented.  
   - Initial testing has been successful, making this a **major milestone** for the fitness app.  

2. **Completion of the Chatting Social Feature**  
   - The **chat feature** is now functional, allowing users to message each other and share achievements.  
   - This addition aligns with our goal of making the app **more interactive and community-driven**.  

3. **Addition of Testing Framework**  
   - Unit and integration tests have been incorporated into the workflow.  
   - Test coverage has improved, ensuring features remain **robust and maintainable**.  

---

### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed  

1. **Multimedia Messaging (Audio, Video, etc.)**  
   - This feature was more complex than expected and had to be postponed.  
   - The team plans to revisit it in future iterations once the core functionalities are stable.  

2. **Workout Scheduling Feature**  
   - Only the **basic setup** was completed due to time constraints.  
   - More work is needed to ensure scheduling integrates smoothly with other features.  

---

### Meeting Highlights  

1. **Improving Schedule Planning**  
   - We need to be **more realistic** about our workload and available time.  
   - Better planning will help distribute tasks more evenly and allocate enough time for **testing and refinement**.  

2. **Data Visualization Focus**  
   - Moving forward, we will focus on implementing **graphs and insights** to help users track their fitness journey.  
   - This will provide **better progress tracking and goal setting** for users.  

3. **Deployment on the Cloud**  
   - Cloud deployment will be a priority to improve **scalability and accessibility**.  
   - This will make future updates smoother and **enhance app reliability**.

By reflecting on this iteration, we can build on the successes, learn from the challenges, and create a more effective workflow and product moving forward.
