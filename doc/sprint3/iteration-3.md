# Ben - Iteration 03

**Start date:** March 13  
**End date:** March 21

## Process

In this iteration, our team has outlined the workflow, responsibilities, and events to help ensure smooth progress and high collaboration. Here's the plan for our team organization and processes.

### Roles & Responsibilities

**Scrum Master: Risheit**  
The Scrum Master will facilitate the team’s agile process, ensuring that meetings run smoothly and the team stays on track. They will help resolve any impediments and guide the team through the sprint. Additionally, Risheit will help manage the backlog and prioritize tasks based on the project's goals.

**Note Taker: Bilal**  
Bilal will be responsible for capturing key points from all meetings, including action items, decisions made, and any other important notes. This will ensure that the team has a clear record of discussions and commitments, and can track progress over the course of the iteration.

### Events

These are the meetings and events that will be central to our iteration. The goal is to keep communication transparent and allow the team to stay aligned with project goals.

#### Review Meeting
**When:** Fridays from 3 - 5 PM (online)  
**Purpose:** The review meeting is essential for reviewing the progress made during the iteration. Team members will present completed work, discuss any challenges encountered, and align on what’s working and what needs improvement. The meeting will also help set the direction for the next iteration and review deliverables.

#### RPMs (Review, Planning, and Management)
**When:** Tuesdays from 1 - 2 PM (online)  
**Purpose:** The RPM meeting is designed to review progress in more detail and plan for the upcoming tasks. It will serve as a formal check-in to ensure that we are on track to meet our goals. Additionally, any changes in scope or resources will be addressed during this time. This is when we will fine-tune our objectives for the week and ensure that our priorities align.

#### Standups
**When:** Weekdays from 4 - 4:15 PM (online)  
**Purpose:** Standups will be short, daily meetings where each team member briefly reports on their progress, any blockers they are facing, and their plan for the day. This keeps everyone aligned and helps identify potential roadblocks early, ensuring that the team stays on track.

#### Task Board
We will use a shared task board (e.g., Trello or Jira) to track ongoing tasks, assign them, and visualize progress. The task board will provide an overview of the project’s status and will allow for easy tracking of task completion. This will be updated regularly to reflect the current state of the project.

#### To-Do Lists
Each team member will create a personal to-do list to help manage their day-to-day priorities and tasks. These lists will be updated as needed and linked to the larger task board to ensure that all team members are aware of their responsibilities.

#### Weekly Task Prioritization
We will prioritize tasks based on urgency and dependencies. Critical tasks will be assigned early in the week, with lower-priority tasks worked on as time allows. This will ensure that the most important items are always being worked on, and the team can stay agile if adjustments are needed.

## Product

The product section outlines our goals for this iteration and the tasks necessary to achieve those goals. We will focus on building key features that will provide value to users and contribute to the app’s overall functionality.

### Goals and Tasks

1. **Basic Data Visualization (Most Frequent Workouts Done by a User)**  
   **Tickets:** Scrum-23  
   We will begin working on a data visualization feature to display the most frequently done workouts. This will give users insight into their workout habits and help them make informed decisions about their fitness routines.

2. **Workout Scheduling**  
   **Tickets:** Scrum-9  
   We need to allow users to schedule their workouts ahead of time. This feature will help users organize their fitness routines and ensure they stay on track with their goals.

3. **Notifications**  
   **Tickets:** Scrum-15  
   Developing a notification system will ensure that users are reminded of their scheduled workouts and can stay informed about their progress. This feature will encourage engagement and retention within the app.

### Artifacts

Here are the artifacts we will produce in this iteration to showcase the progress we’ve made and to present our project idea effectively.

1. **Page with Basic Stats on Frequent Workouts Done**  
   This page will display the user’s most frequently performed workouts, likely through a list of workouts finished. It will help users analyze their workout patterns and set new goals based on this data.

2. **Page with Workout Schedule**  
   This artifact will be an interactive page where users can drop in workouts and organize them into a calendar or schedule. It will provide an overview of their planned workouts and allow for quick adjustments.

3. **Ability to Send Workouts to Others in Messages**  
   A feature where users can share their workout schedules or specific routines with others, either through the app’s internal messaging system or via external platforms like email or social media.
