    **Grader's Notes:** Market research is done nicely and a lot of good and relevant points were touched upon including the market cap, the competitors and specifically what they do, reports from real users on how long they use these apps for, and why they stop using them. There are two suggestions that I would make:
    - It would also be helpful to include research into the different barriers that people may face when thinking about getting into shape/going to the gym for the first time.
      - A potentially large group of users could be those who have no workout experience at all and/or don't want to get into fitness due to one reason or another.
    - (A smaller thing) Include your sources in your proposal; although all the information is useful to the application, listing sources helps provide backing to your ideas (users only use these apps for around 2 months according to what?, etc.)
    
  - The idea is feasible and students could realistically finish an MVP during the course of the semester (max 5 marks)
    - 5 marks = to a high degree
    - 2 mark = to an acceptable degree
    - 0 marks = not at all

    Your mark = 5
    
  - The idea is novel, it shows a level of thought and creativity (max 5 marks)
    - 5 marks = to a high degree
    - 2 mark = to an acceptable degree
    - 0 marks = not at all

    Your mark = 4
    
  - The idea has business potential (max 2 marks)
    - 2 marks = to a high degree
    - 1 mark = to an acceptable degree
    - 0 marks = not at all

    Your mark = 2

    **Grader's Notes:** The idea generally is good, but mostly because it combines a lot of already pre-existing good ideas from many different apps, just all in one place. You might want to consider adding additional features into your web app that no other existing application has already (just some suggestions).
    - In your social media portion, maybe have a specific feature that suggests users who are close to you who workout at the same gyms, doing the same workouts, offering opportunities to connect.
    - In addition to this, maybe you could incorporate a feature that allows two people to create a joint workout schedule together.
      - If Bob and Chad want to workout together, and they want to workout some of the same parts of their body, but not all the same parts, you could have your app take in both of their schedules and workout information, then create a joint workout plan with a customized schedule for each person.

  - Quality of the persona should be measured based on the presence/absence quality of description of the following elements:
      Age, personality, personal background
      Skills, professional background
      Attitude towards technology, domain, etc.
      Goals when using the system
      (max 4 marks)
    - 4 marks = Two or more high quality personas provided
    - 3 marks = Two personas provided but quality is not very good
    - 2 marks = Only 1 persona provided with good quality
    - 1 mark  = One persona of poor quality
    - 0 marks = No personas provided

	  Your mark: 4

    **Grader's Notes:** The personas are really good in general and a small suggestion that I would make would be to just add a tiny bit of technical background for Bob.

  - Relevance to the system  (max 2 marks)
    - 2 marks = Personas are highly relevant to the system 
    - 1 mark  = Personas are somewhat relevant

  **Overall Jira Story Notes:** The descriptions of the stories were empty when they should be filled according to [this resource](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/372980/files/35732781?wrap=1) on Quercus. The reason for each mark deduction is also evident in the relevant sections above.
  - Missing definition of done as well in earlier sections.

  The marks were not deducted due to the number of stories being too little, but the empty descriptions within them.
