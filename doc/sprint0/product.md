#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

Our product idea is a fitness web application that allows users to do all things related to working out such as: log workouts, selecting custom built workout plans or pre-built ones, track progress over time, and interact with other fitness enthusiasts.

As of now, fitness apps focus on either tracking workout progress or a social media application. There is no comprehensive solution to ease users into learning workouts, building workout schedules, tracking and sharing their progress simultaneously. 
Many users instead use traditional everyday apps such as Notes, Calendar, Clock and their choice of social media in place of actual fitness apps since they are sufficient enough. Most people are of the opinion that fitness apps do not offer enough features or reasons to be used.

Our fitness app will help users with their workouts, allow users to build and track their workouts as they progress and also communicate and share their accomplishments with other fitness enthusiasts. The app can work as a personal fitness assistant. It will log workout details such as reps, sets and weights for future reference. It could be used to set workout timers and also provides tutorial videos for certain exercises. 
The app can also function as a workout scheduler. It will let users create personalized workouts from pre-made templates or they may customize their workout schedule. The app will notify the users based on their schedule. The app can even be a progress tracker. The app tracks the data logged by users such as PRs, streaks and goals and condenses it to various measures such as average, best and frequency across time frames. 
The data can be visualized through charts and heatmaps. Additionally, the app will have a social media aspect, allowing users to chat with others and share their pictures and videos through posts. Users will also be able to share their achievements by sharing their charts and goals met.

#### Q2: Who are your target users? (2-3 personas)

See the attached personas.pdf.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

With an $8 billion market cap in the industry, there are a plethora of fitness apps in the market. Hevy and JEFit are popular for workout scheduling, Caliber provides workout tutorials and coaching, MyFitnessPal for nutrition tracking, and Strengthlog or Strong for progress tracking. 
Although there are many fitness apps available for gym-goers, reportedly most users do not use the app for more than two months. The main issue resides in lack of motivation to either work out consistently, or to use the app while working out. Our app addresses the issue by integrating a social media aspect into the app. 
Connected users will find and join their own community of fitness enthusiasts and find the motivation to stay connected as they form social bonds over their shared interest in fitness, in Go Pulse. 
This will keep users motivated to keep working out and also use the app, either in workout sessions or for social connections. 

Additionally, our app encourages progress by tracking user’s workout data offered voluntarily and the ability to set and meet goals and share accomplishments with others. 
Beginners like Bob would be able to connect with local gym-goers and form social bonds over the subject of fitness, giving him motivation to go forward on his fitness journey. Bob can also easily schedule his workouts ahead with Ben’s fitness scheduler and synchronize it with his own busy schedule. 
Bob can also get recommendations on his workouts and schedules and also have access to videos of how to perform his desired exercises, providing him simple and accurate information. Bob can log his workout details so he can use it for future reference and track his progress. 

For lifters like Chad, our app consolidates all the features they use from different apps, increasing efficiency and improving organization. The Ben app also provides a social platform for Chad to find users who share similar interests in fitness. 
The app will also be able help Chad with managing his logged data and condense it to simple and comprehensive aggregations using visuals. 

In conclusion, Go Pulse is a helpful, all-round fitness app capable of making users engage in and connect through fitness for beginners and enthusiasts alike.
