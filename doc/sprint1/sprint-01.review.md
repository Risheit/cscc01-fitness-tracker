### Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

- **PR/Code Reviews were handled efficiently** – Pull requests were promptly reviewed and merged, reducing bottlenecks in development.
- **Merged pages cohesively** – Ensured smooth integration of different sections of the app, improving navigation and UI consistency.
- **Task prioritization was effective** – Focused on foundational features that set up future sprints for success.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

- **Removed 'In Code Review' column in Jira** – This led to less visibility into ongoing reviews, making tracking progress more difficult.
- **Took on too much work for the sprint** – Some tasks, like the bio page, were left unfinished due to an overloaded sprint scope.

#### Planned changes

- **Reduce required PR approvers from 2 to 1** – Speeds up the code review process while maintaining quality control.
- **Ensure docker-compose works in both prod and dev environments** – Avoids environment-related deployment issues and inconsistencies.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed

- **MVP created** – A functional version of the app is available with core features implemented.
- **Effective meeting cadence** – Frequent, punctual meetings helped resolve blockers quickly and kept the team aligned.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed

- **Bio page unfinished** – Mostly done, but some final adjustments are needed before release.
- **Audio Cues not started** - Didn't get the time to start work
- **Workout preset selector** - Didn't get time to start 

#### Meeting Highlights

- **Ensure docker-compose works across all environments** – Critical for smooth deployment and local development.
