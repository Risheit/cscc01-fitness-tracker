# Iteration-01 Plan

## Team Name: Ben

### Process

#### Roles & responsibilities

**Sprint Responsibilities:**

- **Scrum Master: Laksh**  
  As the Scrum Master, Laksh is responsible for ensuring the team follows agile practices, facilitating meetings, and removing any blockers the team may encounter. They also help with prioritizing tasks and ensuring smooth communication within the team.

- **Note Taking: Aashir**  
  Aashir's primary responsibility is to document key points and decisions made during meetings. This ensures that everyone on the team is aligned and that important details are not lost, serving as a reference for future meetings or iterations.

#### Events

The team has planned regular touchpoints to stay aligned and on track with the project:

- **Review Meeting:**  
  The team holds review meetings on Thursdays from 5 - 7 PM online. This allows the team to review the progress of the project, present completed work, and discuss any issues or challenges faced during the sprint. The review meeting is crucial for aligning on what’s working, what needs improvement, and setting goals for the next sprint.

- **RPMs (Review, Planning, and Management):**  
  These meetings are scheduled on Tuesdays from 1 - 2 PM online. RPMs serve as a more formal check-in to ensure that progress is aligned with the initial goals and that any changes in the scope or resources are discussed. It's a chance for the team to align on what needs to be planned for the upcoming week.

- **Standups:**  
  Short daily standups are scheduled for weekdays from 9 - 9:15 PM online. Standups serve as a quick check-in to track the progress of individual tasks, raise potential blockers, and align on the priorities for the day.

#### Artifacts

In terms of artifacts, the team plans to stay organized through the following:

- **To-Do Lists and Task Boards:**  
  To track work, the team will create a to-do list of tasks, with clear deadlines and priorities. A task board (potentially using a tool like Trello or Jira) will help to visualize the status of tasks (e.g., “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done”), making it easy to see what’s on track and what requires attention.

- **Schedule and Timeline:**  
  The team will create and maintain a project timeline that outlines the milestones and deliverables for each sprint. This helps everyone stay focused and aligned with the end goals of the project.

- **Prioritization System:**  
  To prioritize tasks, the team will use a ranking system, where tasks are sorted based on urgency and importance. This ensures that critical features, such as the MVP and core components of the app, are worked on first, while less critical features are addressed later.

- **Task Assignment:**  
  Tasks will be assigned based on the strengths and availability of team members. The Scrum Master will ensure that work is evenly distributed, and the team will discuss the most suitable person for each task during the sprint planning meeting.

## Product

### Goals and tasks

The team's goals for this iteration are to create a basic MVP of the fitness app and establish the foundational work for key features. This includes:

- **Workout Selection:**  
  The MVP will allow users to select workouts. This could include offering predefined workouts or allowing users to create their own routines.

- **Fitness Workout:**  
  The app will allow users to have a visual representation of progress for their workouts through timers and rep counters

- **Database of Exercises:**  
  The team aims to compile a comprehensive database that lists exercises, along with their names and reference videos showing how to perform them correctly. This will be useful for both educating users and helping them perform exercises safely.

### Artifacts

To present the project idea, the team will produce the following artifacts:

- **Local MVP of the Website:**  
  The MVP will showcase a working prototype of the app. This could include the basic app flow, where users can select and log workouts. This artifact will help the team identify any gaps or issues early and allow them to iterate quickly.

- **Rep Counter Page:**  
  This page will track and display the user's workout rep and set count for each exercise. This is an essential component for tracking the progress of rep-based workouts accurately

- **Timer Page(s):**  
  A page or set of pages for tracking the user's workout timing, such as countdown timers for each exercise or rest period. This is an essential component for tracking the timing of workouts accurately.

- **“Workout Finished” Page:**  
  This page will show the user that their workout has been completed. It may include options for saving their progress, viewing their stats, or suggesting next steps. It’s important to create a satisfying end to the user's workout session.

These artifacts will serve to demonstrate the core functionalities of the fitness app and allow for a smooth user experience while providing a foundation for future enhancements.
