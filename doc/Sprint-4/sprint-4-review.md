# Team Ben – Iteration 04: Review & Retrospective

## Meeting Details
- **Date:** April 4  
- **Location:** Online

## Process Reflection

### Decisions That Turned Out Well

#### Effective Use of CI/CD for Test Reliability
Our adoption of CI/CD pipelines proved highly beneficial, particularly in maintaining test stability during merges. This approach ensured that only passing builds were integrated, leading to a more stable codebase.

#### Accurate Capacity Estimation
Our team's estimation of workload capacity for this iteration was well-calibrated. This allowed us to plan realistically and complete the majority of our objectives without overcommitting or experiencing burnout.

### Decisions That Did Not Turn Out as Well as Expected

#### Avoidance of a Single Branch Structure
We decided against using a single-branch model, anticipating it might negatively impact Git history clarity. However, this led to occasional confusion and merge conflicts across multiple branches. In retrospect, a more unified branching strategy, paired with proper version control practices, could have streamlined our workflow.

### Planned Changes
There are currently no planned changes to our team processes for the upcoming iteration.

## Product Review

### Goals and Tasks Successfully Completed

- **Data Visualization Feature**  
  _SCRUM-23, SCRUM-19, SCRUM-22_  
  Successfully implemented data visualization components to enhance user interaction with performance metrics.

- **Workout Scheduling**  
  _SCRUM-9_  
  The workout scheduling feature was completed, allowing users to plan and organize their fitness routines effectively.

- **Workout Comments and Summaries**  
  _SCRUM-27, SCRUM-22_  
  Users can now view and leave comments on workouts, as well as view automated summaries upon workout completion.

- **User Interface Overhaul**  
  _SCRUM-84_  
  A major redesign of the UI was completed, improving usability and visual appeal across the application.

- **Profile Page**  
  _SCRUM-106, SCRUM-106_  
  The profile page feature was successfully integrated, enabling users to manage and view personal fitness information.

### Goals and Tasks Not Completed

- **Custom Achievements**  
  This feature was deprioritized due to time constraints and the focus on core functionality.

- **Heatmaps**  
  We opted to not work on this feature as it requires more data infrastructure than is currently available.

- **Sharing Videos and Images**  
  This story was deferred due to limited backend support and evolving priorities.

- **Delete Conversations**  
  We decided not to proceed with this functionality in this iteration, as it was deemed less critical compared to other deliverables.

## Meeting Highlights and Key Takeaways

- **Maintain Effective Use of CI/CD**  
  Our CI/CD setup contributed significantly to build stability and should remain a core part of our development workflow.

- **Continue Estimating Workload Conservatively**  
  Our accurate capacity planning allowed for efficient workload distribution without overburdening team members.

- **Re-evaluate Branching Strategy**  
  The multi-branch approach caused some confusion and merge conflicts; we should explore adopting a more streamlined branching model in future iterations.

- **Prioritize Core Features Over Extras**  
  Our decision to focus on critical deliverables like scheduling, data visualization, and UI redesign proved effective. Optional features should be scheduled only if capacity allows.
