**When:** March 21  
**Where:** ONLINE

## **Process - Reflection**

#### **Decisions that turned out well**

1. **PRs to 1 Approval, Quicker Approvals**  
   We streamlined our pull request process by requiring only one approval for each PR. This significantly reduced the time spent waiting for approvals, allowing us to move through development faster and keep momentum going.

2. **Meeting Time of 4:30 PM**  
   The new meeting time of 4:30 PM worked well for all team members. This adjustment allowed for better attendance and engagement during meetings, ensuring that everyone could participate and contribute.

3. **Task Prioritization with Shared Task Board**  
   Using a shared task board (Trello) to track tasks and personal to-do lists helped us stay organized and prioritize effectively. This clear visualization of tasks allowed us to maintain focus and track progress efficiently.

#### **Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped**

1. **Overestimation of Team Capacity**  
   Whilst imporving on past iterations in terms of leftover work, we ended up overestimating our capacity to complete certain tasks, particularly in the late stages of the iteration. This led to delays, especially with the timetable scheduler feature. In future iterations, we need to better assess our workload and capacity during planning to avoid this issue.

#### **Planned changes**

1. **Switch to a Single Main Branch**  
   We plan to simplify our Git workflow by moving to a single main branch instead of using both `dev` and `main`. This will streamline our development process, reduce the complexity of merges, and make deployment faster.

2. **Change from Local Container to WebSocket Server + DB**  
   We aim to improve scalability and performance by transitioning from a local container setup to a WebSocket server with a dedicated database. This change will allow for better real-time updates and smoother overall app performance.

## **Product - Review**

#### **Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:**

1. **Notifications**  
   The notification feature was successfully implemented, allowing users to receive reminders for their scheduled workouts. This feature has been fully integrated into the app and is improving user engagement.

2. **Chat UI **  
   The basic chat UI and conversation's having ability to send workouts functionality have been completed. These features allow users to communicate with each other more effectively and manage their conversations, enhancing the overall user experience.

4. **Personalized Workouts**  
   Personalized workout suggestions have been successfully integrated, offering users recommendations based on their past activities. This feature has been well-received and adds value by making workouts more tailored to individual needs.

5. **Bio Page**  
   The bio page functionality was finalized, allowing users to create and update their profiles with custom information. This feature helps enhance user personalization and profile management.

#### **Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:**

1. **Timetable Scheduler**  
   The timetable scheduler feature was planned but not completed. We ran into delays due to our initial overestimation of capacity, and it was pushed back in favor of other features that were prioritized. We plan to complete it in the next iteration.
3. **Data Visualization**  
   The data visualization feature for tracking the most frequent workouts has not been completed. The workflow process has been set up but logged workouts aren't unique to users as of now, this will be completed early next sprint.

## **Meeting Highlights**

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

1. **Finishing Timetable Scheduler**  
   The timetable scheduler remains a key priority and must be completed in the next iteration. This feature is crucial for users to organize and plan their workouts effectively, and it will be a significant addition to the app.

2. **Deployment Focus**  
   In the next iteration, we aim to focus on deployment and ensure that the app is deployed smoothly with minimal issues. This includes integrating the new server and database setup and optimizing backend processes.

3. **Expanding on Data Visualization**  
   Firstly, we plan on finishing up the unique data visualization for users.
   Secondly, we plan to further expand on the data visualization features, adding more detailed metrics and customization options. This will provide users with deeper insights into their fitness progress and increase engagement with the app.
